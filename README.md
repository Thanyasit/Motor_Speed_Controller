# Motor Speed Controller
## Description:
This program controls a motor speed controller using a push button and a potentiometer. The code is written in Arduino language and uses an Arduino board to control the motor. The program also includes a speaker output and LED indication.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Arduino board
## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the "motor_speed_controller.ino" file in Arduino IDE
3. Connect the Arduino board to your computer via USB cable
4. Select the appropriate board and port in Arduino IDE
5. Upload the code to the board
## Usage

1. Connect the motor to the motor speed controller pins
2. Connect the potentiometer to the sensor pin
3. Connect the push button to the pushbutton pin
4. Connect the speaker to the speaker pin
5. Turn on the power to the motor and the Arduino board
6. Turn the potentiometer to adjust the motor speed
7. Press the push button to increase the motor speed
8. Use the switch to change the motor direction
9. The built-in LED and speaker indicate the status of the motor speed and direction
